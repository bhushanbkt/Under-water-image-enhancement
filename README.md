Under water image enhancement using deep learning 
 underwater object tracking is a difficult task due to the low quality of underwater visual data. Underwater visual data suffers distortions in contrast and sharpness, as a result of refraction and absorption of light, and particles, which all vary dependent on the depth, color and nature of water
